        <p>
          I started my journey into tech in high school when my teacher threw the District-selected textbook out the window like a frisbee & said, "That is total bullshit! I'm teaching you all real computer stuff. We're learning to code in BASIC!" I completed all 9 weekly projects in 4 weeks, & spent the final 5 weeks of the class helping my classmates to debug & to troubleshoot their code, building extra projects for fun, & installing programs on the lab computers to help the teacher. He told me that I should go to college for Computer Science. I should have listened to him.

          Many years later, I participated in a web development bootcamp through <a href=""launchcode.org">LaunchCode</a>, & graduated in March 2023. Since then, I've actively fought to get into tech. My interview on Tuesday will be the first step through that door.

          On a personal note, my favorite animals are foxes! So, I welcome everyone to join me in the fox cult. Small "c" cult. No koolaid. Just appreciation for the awesomeness of foxes. Welcome!
